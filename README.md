# Ultra Sonic Radar with Security Alarm

This project features an Ultra Sonic Radar with a Security Alarm system. It showcases proficiency in integrating sensors and developing embedded systems for security applications. The system includes a visually intuitive interface created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Processing software to display real-time radar data and alarms through custom graphics.

## Features

- **Ultra Sonic Radar**: Detects objects within its range using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Security Alarm**: Sounds an alarm when an object is detected within a specified range.
- **Embedded Systems Integration**: Demonstrates proficiency in integrating sensors and developing embedded systems for security applications.
- **Customizable Interface**: Utilizes JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Processing software to create a visually intuitive interface for displaying real-time radar data and alarms.
- **Version Control**: Developed using Git for version control, ensuring easy collaboration and project management.
- **IDE**: Developed in VS Code for efficient coding and debugging.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for creating dynamic behavior of the interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web-based interface.
- **Processing**: Used for visualizing radar data and alarms through custom graphics.
- **Embedded Systems**: Integrated with ultrasonic sensors for object detection.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing and collaborating on the project.
- **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment used for coding and debugging.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultrasonic-radar-security-alarm.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE.
3. Ensure you have Processing software installed for visualization.
4. Connect the ultrasonic sensors to your embedded system as per the provided hardware integration instructions.
5. Customize the interface as needed to match your preferences.
6. Run the code to start the radar system and security alarm.

## Usage

1. Open the web-based interface in a browser.
2. The radar system will start detecting objects within its range.
3. If an object is detected within the specified range, the security alarm will sound.
4. Monitor the interface for real-time radar data and alarm notifications.
